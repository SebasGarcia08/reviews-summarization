# Abstractive summarization to improve the consumer-generated online data analysis 

## Abstract

Before going to a restaurant, people read reviews and comments from dedicated websites like Yelp, TripAdvisor or Booking. They want to reduce the risk associated with the decision to go in that location to share a dinner or a lunch with family or friends. These comments are if they are put all together thousands of sentences which are quite difficult to summarise for a human to get a comprehensive opinion of the location. While prior researches have proposed solutions to analyse quantitively the reviews (i.e. the valence and volume of comments), this study proposes a model based on an innovative Attention-Transformer architecture based on a T5 Google model. The results reveal the text summarization by rubric (quality of the food, service quality, environment conditions, COVID protection measures) allows a more accurate description of the restaurant performance than the current stars system and the existing filter method. For citizens, it is a new approach to have access to information before deciding. For managers, it helps to determine what customer value most and the actions plan to improve the quality and the customer experience inside their premises.
