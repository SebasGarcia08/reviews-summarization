And although it was pricey, I perceived it as a good value because of the service and quality. I recently had a family dinner there, and was tremendously disappointed. The prices have increased so much as to no longer present a \"value\", and the food has become mediocre. A wedge salad at $16.95 does not include bacon / blue cheese crumbles, which are an add-on at significant price (every wedge salad I have ordered anywhere comes with bacon and blue cheese crumbles at significantly lower cost). My wife\\'s dinner salad looked awful when it came out. The steak prices have increased quite a bit. So much as to turn me away for future dinners. Pappas does make the best Old Fashioned in town - and lobster bisque too. So there is still some good in this restaurant. Just not enough for me to return. Too pricey for what you get.
